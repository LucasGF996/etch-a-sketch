Etch-a-sketch sketchpad / toy

Create an Etch-a-Sketch sketchpad using JS to manipulate the DOM. The skills learned in this challenge:
    - DOM manipulation: Create, update, delete nodes
    - CSS: Styling attributes by changing their properties defined in a class ".class" or an ID "#ID"
    - JS: eventListeners

Secret to do list:
    - Current version contains redundant code. I might be able to use functions with callbacks to shorten the code.
    - Current version lacks comment code.
    - Current version is not visually pleasing.
